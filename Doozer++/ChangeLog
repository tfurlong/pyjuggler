DATE       AUTHOR       CHANGE
---------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------
2003-01-15 patrickh     Added the cygcl.pl Perl script as a replacement for
                        msvccc.  Using cygcl, the NSPR and OpenGL Performer
                        macros are now safe to use when the installation
                        directory contains spaces.
2003-02-07 patrickh     The OpenGL Performer macro works on Windows.
2002-12-04 patrickh     Began overhauling the macros DPP_HAVE_SUBSYNTH,
                        DPP_HAVE_PORTAUDIO, DPP_HAVE_AUDIOWORKS, and
                        DPP_HAVE_GLUT.  See RELEASE_NOTES.txt for required
                        migration changes.
2002-12-02 patrickh     Added macros for determining which linker to use and if
                        that linker is GNU ld.
2002-12-02 patrickh     Swapped the order of the first two arguments to
                        DPP_HAVE_CPPUNIT.
                        Added the new macro DPP_CHECK_DYNLOAD_LIB.
2002-11-27 patrickh     Rewrote the CppUnit detection macro.  The command-line
                        argument it adds has been changed to --with-cppunit.
                        It now takes another argument specifying the minimum
                        required version.
2002-09-18 nonchocoboy  Renamed dos2unix and unix2dos to unixpath and dospath
                        respectively.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.5.1
2002-08-08 patrickh     NEW VERSION: 1.5.0
2002-08-16 patrickh     Separated compiler-sepcific setup from system-specific
                        setup.  There is now a macro called DPP_COMPILER_SETUP
                        that handles the compiler-specific configuration.  It
                        is called automaticaly by DPP_PROG_CC and DPP_PROG_CXX.
                        DPP_SYSTEM_SUBST is now an empty macro.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.108
2002-08-02 patrickh     Run bsd-install.pl relative to $(DPP_SCRIPTDIR).
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.107
2002-07-31 patrickh     Added a new macro, DPP_PROG_INSTALL, that finds a
                        BSD-compatible install(1) tool.  It favors the use of
                        bsd-install.pl (added earlier today) because it's
                        smarter and more robust than other similar utilities.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.106
2002-07-31 patrickh     Revamped DPP_PERL_VER to work better and to deal with
                        the version numbering change between Perl 5.005 and
                        5.6.0.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.105
2002-07-31 patrickh     Added a Perl script that provides better compatibility
                        with BSD install(1) than install-sh.
2002-05-28 patrickh     The DPP_HAVE_BOOST() macro now takes a version number
                        as its first argument.  The other arguments have been
                        "shifted over" one position as a result.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.104
2002-04-06 patrickh     Improved support for forcing the use of GCC for
                        compiling.  Improved support for use of Doozer++ m4
                        macros with Autoconf 2.5x.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.102
2002-12-14 patrickh     Added the ability to specify the path to the NSPR
                        headers in the DPP_HAVE_NSPR macro through the use of
                        a new command line option (--with-nspr-includes).  Part
                        of this change included a modifcation to the argument
                        list of DPP_NSPR_VER.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.101
2002-01-13 subatomic    Added tests for CppUnit and Boost.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Added dpp.simple-app.mk, a backend makefile stub for
                        compiling a single application from a (potentially
                        complex) source base.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Fixed DPP_VERSION_COMPARE for all platforms.  ksh(1) is
                        no longer required at all on Solaris.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.99
2001-12-19 patrickh     Initial support for building profiled libraries in
                        addition to debugging and optimized versions.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.98
2001-12-10 patrickh     Fixed a major bug in DPP_VERSION_COMPARE that prevented
                        it from ever working correctly.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.97
2001-12-06 patrickh     Changed the search order for the macro DPP_PATH_JAVA.
                        The new order gives preference to the
                        command-line-specified path which makes sense.
2001-11-18 patrickh     Added -DPIC to the C and C++ compiler's dynamic library
                        command-line arguments.
2001-11-15 patrickh     Added recognition of a new variable to dpp.install.mk
                        that allows users to list subdirectories for recursion
                        where only installation will occur.
2001-11-13 patrickh     Version number changed to 1.4.95 after the addition of
                        DPP_JDK_VERSION.
2001-11-10 patrickh     Generalized the IDL support.
2001-10-12 patrickh     Increased version to 1.4.94 after successful testing
                        with Autoconf 2.52 and Automake 1.5.  ace.m4 and
                        nspr.m4 had circular dependencies that Autoconf 2.5x
                        does not allow.
2001-09-06 patrickh     The targets for building shared libraries (DLLs) have
                        been renamed to avoid confusion.
