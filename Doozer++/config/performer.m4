dnl
dnl Command-line options added:
dnl     --with-pfroot - Give the root directory of the Perfromer installation.
dnl     --with-pfver  - Give the Performer version installed on the target
dnl                     system.
dnl
dnl Variables defined:
dnl     PFROOT      - The Performer installation directory.
dnl     PF_VER      - The Performer version being used.
dnl     LIBERFORMER - The list of libraries to link for Performer appliations.

dnl ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnl Determine if the target system has IRIS/OpenGL Performer installed.  This
dnl adds command-line arguments --with-pfroot and --with-pfver.
dnl
dnl Usage:
dnl     DPP_HAVE_PERFORMER(pfroot [, version, [, action-if-found [, action-if-not-found]])
dnl
dnl Arguments:
dnl     pfroot              - The default directory where the Performer
dnl                           installation is rooted.  This directory should
dnl                           contain an include/Performer directory with the
dnl                           Performer headers and a lib (with appropriate
dnl                           bit suffix) directory with the Performer
dnl                           libraries.  The value given is used as the
dnl                           default value of the --with-prfroot command-line
dnl                           argument.
dnl     version             - Specify which version of Performer will be used.
dnl                           The value given is used as the default value of
dnl                           the --with-pfver command-line argument.  This
dnl                           argument is optional and if not specified, it
dnl                           assumes version 2.4.
dnl     action-if-found     - The action to take if Performer is found.  This
dnl                           argument is optional.
dnl     action-if-not-found - The action to take if Performer is not found.
dnl                           This argument is optional.
