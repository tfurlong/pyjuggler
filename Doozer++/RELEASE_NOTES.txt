      affect applications.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.5.1
Released: January 4, 2003

    New features:
        * The following macros have been added:

             - DPP_CHECK_DYNLOAD_LIB: Determines what library, if any, is
               needed for performing dynamic code loading at runtime
             - DPP_PROG_LINKER: Determines what linker is in use
             - DPP_LINKER_IS_GNU_LD: Determines if the linker is GNU ld

        * Capabilities for building static libraries alongside dynamic
          libraries on Win32 have been added.

    Bugs fixed:
        * Mac OS X 10.2 is detected properly.

    Required changes when upgrading from 1.5.0:
        * The helper functions for converting paths have been renamed as
          follows:

             - dos2unix ==> unixpath
             - unix2dos ==> dospath

        * The macro DPP_HAVE_CPPUNIT has been modified in the following ways:

             1. The command-line parameter it adds is now --with-cppunit.
             2. Its argument list now takes as its first parameter the
                minimum required CppUnit version.  The other arguments have
                been shifted over one position.
             3. The variable $CPPUNITROOT is now spelled $CPPUNIT_ROOT.

        * The macro DPP_HAVE_PORTAUDIO has been modified in the following
          ways:

             1. Renamed the command-line argument to --with-portaudio
             2. Renamed substitution variables as follows:
                  PAROOT      --> PORTAUDIO_ROOT
                  PA_INCLUDES --> PORTAUDIO_INCLUDES
                  PA_LDFLAGS  --> PORTAUDIO_LDFLAGS

        * The macro DPP_HAVE_SUBSYNTH has been modified in the following ways:

             1. Renamed the command-line argument to --with-subsynth
             2. Renamed substitution variables as follows:
                  SYNROOT      --> SUBSYNTH_ROOT
                  SYN_INCLUDES --> SUBSYNTH_INCLUDES
                  SYN_LDFLAGS  --> SUBSYNTH_LDFLAGS

        * The macro DPP_HAVE_AUDIOWORKS has been modified in the following
          ways:

             1. Changed the name of the command-line argument to
                --with-audioworks
             2. Changed substitution variable names as follows:
                  AWROOT      - AUDIOWORKS_ROOT
                  AW_INCLUDES - AUDIOWORKS_INCLUDES
                  AW_LDFLAGS  - AUDIOWORKS_LDFLAGS

        * The macro DPP_HAVE_GLUT has been modified in the following ways:

             1. The command-line argument has been renamed to --with-glut.
             2. The root directory variable has been renamed from $GLUTROOT
                to $GLUT_ROOT.

 Version: 1.5.0
Released: September 8, 2002

    New features:
        * The character for separating components of the Java classpath
          (as specified using the -classpath argument to java) is now named
          in the variable $(JCPS).  On UNIX-based systems, the value is :,
          and on Win32, it is ;.

    Bugs fixed:
        * The order of preference for finding a JDK installation has changed
          so that command-line options and environment variables override
          what might be found just by searching the user's path.  The new
          order is:

             1. Search path given on the command line (--with-jdkhome)
             2. Search in the path(s) given as arguments to this macro
             3. Search in $JDK_HOME (if it is set)
             4. Search in the user's path
             5. Search in a preset list of common locations

    Required changes when upgrading from 1.4.x:
        * The targets for building shared libraries (DLLs) have been renamed
          for the sake of clarity.  The name changes are as follows:

              ddso         --> dbg-dso
              dso          --> opt-dso
              install-ddso --> install-dbg-dso
              install-dso  --> install-opt-dso

        * DPP_NSPR_VER now takes four arguments instead of three.  The
          argument new usage is:

              DPP_NSPR_VER(nspr-root, nspr-inc, version [, action-if-not-found])

          This differs from Doozer++ 1.4 by the second argument, nspr-inc.
          The new argument specifies the path to the NSPR headers.  For a
          quick update, just use the value of nspr-root with "/include"
          appended.

        * DPP_BASIC_PROGS no longer checks for a BSD-compatible install(1)
          utility.  Use DPP_PROG_INSTALL(no) for functionality similar to
          Doozer++ 1.4.x.
