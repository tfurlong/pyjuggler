                            Doozer++ Release Notes
                            ----------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.5.0
Released: September 8, 2002

    New features:
        * The character for separating components of the Java classpath
          (as specified using the -classpath argument to java) is now named
          in the variable $(JCPS).  On UNIX-based systems, the value is :,
          and on Win32, it is ;.

    Bugs fixed:
        * The order of preference for finding a JDK installation has changed
          so that command-line options and environment variables override
          what might be found just by searching the user's path.  The new
          order is:

             1. Search path given on the command line (--with-jdkhome)
             2. Search in the path(s) given as arguments to this macro
             3. Search in $JDK_HOME (if it is set)
             4. Search in the user's path
             5. Search in a preset list of common locations

    Required changes when upgrading from 1.4.x:
        * The targets for building shared libraries (DLLs) have been renamed
          for the sake of clarity.  The name changes are as follows:

              ddso         --> dbg-dso
              dso          --> opt-dso
              install-ddso --> install-dbg-dso
              install-dso  --> install-opt-dso

        * DPP_NSPR_VER now takes four arguments instead of three.  The
          argument new usage is:

              DPP_NSPR_VER(nspr-root, nspr-inc, version [, action-if-not-found])

          This differs from Doozer++ 1.4 by the second argument, nspr-inc.
          The new argument specifies the path to the NSPR headers.  For a
          quick update, just use the value of nspr-root with "/include"
          appended.

        * DPP_BASIC_PROGS no longer checks for a BSD-compatible install(1)
          utility.  Use DPP_PROG_INSTALL(no) for functionality similar to
          Doozer++ 1.4.x.
