# PyJuggler
PyJuggler is a Python module that allows VR Juggler application objects to be written in Python. It makes use of the Boost.Python library (currently at version 2). VR Juggler application objects written in Python are loaded into the VR Juggler kernel (written in C++) and executed as though they were "normal" C++ application objects. The result is that highly portable VR Juggler applications can be written quickly and easily in Python.
