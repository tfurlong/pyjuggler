__doc__ = '''PyJuggler.vrj is a module that imports the symbols from
PyJuggler.__vrj into its namespace. PyJuggler.vrj.opengl, PyJuggler.vrj.osg,
and PyJuggler.vrj.opensg are optional modules, and importing one or both may
fail if the module was not compiled or if the Open Scene Graph and/or OpenSG
libraries are not available at run time.

Refer to the PyJuggler.__vrj, PyJuggler.vrj.osg, and PyJuggler.vrj.opensg
modules for class documentation.
